Ref : https://youtu.be/CzRM-hOe35o


Asp.Net Core MVC with Identity UI - User Authentication, Registration, Authorization, and User Profile Management.

First of all, ASP.NET Core Identity is added to an existing project. We could directly update/ override razor pages from Identity as per requirement.
